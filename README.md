# PAPI Multisig Tool

PAPI Multisig Tool is a dApp to create and submit multisig calls without an indexer.

It lets you create shareable URLs with the multisig call info pre-poplated (chain, call data and multisig account), so you can share it with your peers, and every member of the multisig will be able to approve the call.

## Getting started

It's built with React and Vite, so to run it in dev mode:

```sh
pnpm i
pnpm dev
```
